			<p>Multichord is a multimedia creative venture.</p>

      You are a (guitarist or keyboardist) non-musician.
      The chords of the same kind look too different to you and you get confused having to memorize them. The very equal temperament is confusing (problem is tuning and programming).
      You need an intuitive approach to music (solution is stepless scale and intuitive interface).
      This hybrid of guitar and keyboard (and the app) solves this problem.

      -You are an artist or an aspiring one.
      -The guitar or keyboard is a familiar .
      -But you can not get completely used to all its quirkiness.
      -And don't think it's part of the art.
      
      -Sometimes you wonder if it has to be that complicated.
      -And if it is the only way of doing this.
      -Don't memorize chords or use complex synthesizer interfaces.
      -There is a better way, which seems the most intuitive.
      
      -You combine notes on the equally tempered scale.
      -The natural intervals can replace them.
      -They can be used for sound design as well.
      -Get the app and the instrument.

			<p>Progressive rock
      which combines the classic and futuristic forms of this music,
      and social and political science fiction with complex emotional situations in the lyrics,
      with overdubbing a lot of tracks so they create a soundscape.</p>

			<p>[applet, pics and video of app and device]</p>
			
			<p align='right'>The app for audio synthesis and spectrum editing looks like a stepless playing surface and a canvas,<br/>
			with the time coordinate sliding along while recording,<br/>
			and the spectral brush making a stroke whenever and wherever on the pitch scale a note is played.<br/><br/>
      Brushes are drawn or coded like in graphical software.<br/>
      It is simple to edit the audio then as you don’t have to break it down from a waveform.<br/>
      The scale is not limited to the equal temperament.<br/>
      </p>
			
			<p align='left'>The musical instrument looks like a board the size of a guitar, tuned like a piano,<br/>
			that can be carried by a single person.<br/><br/>
			There are 12 or 24 strings and many frets on it, more than on a guitar,<br/>to play it by pressing the strings upon.<br/><br/>
      Volume is changed by the area of finger touch on the surface, <br/>and its alignment or movement along the string alters the pitch.<br/><br/>
      Still it is easy to play as it is tuned the same as any keyboard<br/> and pitch intervals are shown on the surface.

			The history of this project goes back to 2001, when I was 14 or 15.<br/>
			I wanted to understand why the guitar and keyboard are tuned this way and not any other.<br/>
			I found out what the <u>tempered scale</u> was. This was a convention I wanted to break out of.<br/>
			I invented an instrument that consisted of several <u>ribbon controllers</u> (the multitouch screens were not yet popular).<br/>
			I didn't get round to making it then.<br/>
			[pic]<br/>
			I began studying synthesizer programming and discovered that audio can be:<br/>

				<blockquote>recorded<br/>
				programmed as code or in a modular way<br/>
				visualized <u>spectrally</u> as a combination of harmonics and noise<br/>
				presented as a table of numbers<br/>
				sampled and described with keywords to be searchable<br/></blockquote>

			There are other means of synthesis like <u>wavelets</u> or <u>FM</u>, but only the intuitive ones interested me.<br/>

			Ages after <u>quadrophony</u> went out of fashion and was replaced by Surround, I invented this as well.<br/>
			[pic]<br/>

			Then the touchscreens went on sale, but I wanted to simplify things. Audio doesn't have to be synthesized. Why not strings instead of a keyboard?<br/>
			[pic]<br/>

			As well, I don't like paying for software. I like free software and suppose everyone else does.<br/>
			You have to pay for the hardware, but I don't want even that. So Multichord is a non-profit.<br/>

			I don't want the customer to grab their purchase and run away. <br/>
			I want them to stay with the community and be part of it, being promoted and spreading the word, me and them being mutual fans and friends.
