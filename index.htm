<h2>What was only possible with electronic music has become a real instrument.</h2>
<p>
12-step equal temperament is a universally accepted balance between harmony, usability and variety of note combinations.
The domination of it over modern music causes artists to reuse chord patterns and melodies without being original.
Previously only keyboard programmers or multitouch device and software synth owners could avoid these limits.
Now you can achieve the same while tapping the strings along the just intonation scale and keep in tune.

    <b>&lt; Bamboo surface in place of frets</b><br/>
    The fret markings are engraved, so they don't wear off.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; 12 strings with any tuning guitars can have</b><br/>
    Tune the strings to equal intervals between them and find all chords easily.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; Shoulder strap to hold it in place while you stand or sit</b><br/>
    Hold the guitar vertically so the distances between the notes look similar anywhere.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; Usual electric guitar output jack, humbuckers, tuning pegs and truss rod</b><br/>
    The solid body of the instrument is made of light bamboo wood, which has no effect on tone or sustain.

  <b>Tuning</b><br /><br />
  The guitar can be tuned like a piano, one or two semitones between open strings.<br />
  But a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_thirds_tuning">major thirds tuning</a>, with an interval like the one between the second and third string of a guitar, is also an option.<br/>
  It makes it more easily playable than the general fourths or fifths tuning of stringed instruments, as the notes of basic chords are on the frets next to each other.<br />

<div>
  <b>Accessories</b><br /><br />
  Demper, note markings and interval ruler are included.<br/>
  A Raspberry Pi guitar processor will be sold separately.
